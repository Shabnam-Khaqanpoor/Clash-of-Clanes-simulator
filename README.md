This project is a small simulation game inspired by Clash of Clans, implemented using Java, JavaFX, and threads. The game recreates the dynamic interactions between heroes and buildings, utilizing multithreading to handle concurrent actions such as hero movements, attacks, and building defenses. The user interface and visual elements are developed with JavaFX to provide an engaging experience. This project showcases my skills in Java programming, multithreading, and game development.
