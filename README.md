# Clash of Clans-Inspired Simulation Game 

##  **Project Overview**
This project is a **small simulation game** inspired by **Clash of Clans**. It recreates dynamic interactions between **heroes** and **buildings** in a game environment. The game utilizes **Java**, **JavaFX**, and **multithreading** to handle concurrent actions such as:
- **Hero movements** 
- **Hero attacks** 
- **Building defenses** 

The user interface (UI) and visual elements are created with **JavaFX**, providing an engaging and interactive experience for players. This project is an excellent demonstration of my skills in **Java programming**, **multithreading**, and **game development**.

##  **Features**
- **Heroes**: Move, attack, and defend buildings in real-time.
- **Buildings**: Defend against hero attacks and perform actions.
- **Multithreading**: Handle multiple concurrent tasks such as hero actions and building defenses simultaneously without lag.
- **JavaFX Interface**: A dynamic and interactive UI for an immersive game experience.
- **Real-time Updates**: The game updates in real-time with visual feedback for every action taken by heroes or buildings.

##  **Technologies Used**
- **Java**: Core programming language for logic and game mechanics.
- **JavaFX**: Used for developing the interactive user interface and visual elements.
- **Multithreading**: To handle concurrent operations like hero movements, attacks, and building functions.

##  **Project Highlights**
- **Multithreading**: Efficient handling of multiple tasks in parallel ensures smooth game performance.
- **JavaFX UI**: A fully functional UI that updates in real-time based on the ongoing interactions within the game.
- **Real-time Interactions**: Heroes and buildings interact with each other based on predefined game logic, simulating a realistic game environment.

##  **Learning Outcomes**
This project showcases my ability to implement key concepts such as:
- **Java programming** for game mechanics.
- **JavaFX** for creating engaging and responsive user interfaces.
- **Multithreading** to handle concurrent actions in game development.
